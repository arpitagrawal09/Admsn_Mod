Sample web app for university admissions. 

PREPARED 

1. Database for course structure 
2. Form page 1 : Selecting exact course using dependent dropdowns

STEPS to use

1) Populate database `mock_admissions_1` using the sql dump file at reg_form/db_schema/master_table/dump_21_01_2023.sql
2) Open the form at reg_form/pages_all/formPage.php

Expected functionality : No. of dependent dropdowns with the course combination would occur. The previous one would change the next options.
