# univ_admission_mod
Sample web app for university admissions(Incomplete)

Only the page to choose the course from a cascade of selections seems to be functional
Steps to use 

1) Fill an empty database using the sql dump file at reg_form/db_schema/master_table/
2) Open the page 'loginPage.php'

Expected functionality : No. of dependent dropdowns with the course combinatino would occur. The previous one would change the next options.
